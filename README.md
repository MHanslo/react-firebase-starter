## React / Redux Firebase Starter

> [React / Redux Firebase Starter](https://github.com/MHanslo/react-firebase-starter)
> is a React starter kit, built upon [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
> This project adds further tools such as [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
> for state management, [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
> for routing, [Redux Auth Wrapper](https://github.com/mjrussell/redux-auth-wrapper)
> for managing authentication access,
> and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for a real-time serverless backend.

## Getting Started

For all information on scripts, features, and issues, please head over to
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and
give the documentation a read there.<br>

This project adds a few more features on top of Create React App for quicker
scaffolding for a project using Redux and Firebase and ships with a simple
login and sign up service handled by Firebase.

## Configuring Firebase
To get Firebase working, make a copy of `.env.example` in the root directory,
rename it to `.env` and add your Firebase credentials there. The different
Firebase services can be configured and exported in `src/firebase/config.js`.
